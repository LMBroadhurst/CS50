## Binary
Used to speak to computers, in the form of zeros and ones.
Similar to on/off, storing electricity with transistors.
0 = no electricity stored, 1 = electricity stored.
Bit - single binary digit.
Sequences of bits create significantly more complex values.

// Go over how a base 2 system can create numbers.

Byte - equal to 8 bits - 00000000 = 0. 11111111 = 255. 
Actually 256 representations but start at 0, so we have the values 0 - 255 which is 256 representations of a byte.

## Applying to letters...
A = binary 65 = 0100_0001 = 64 + 1
        128_64_32_16_8421 # each 0 and 1 represents the prior numbers.
This is ASCII, american standard _ _ _.

## Unicode
Now the standard to use, it's a superset of ASCII.
Often uses 16, 24, and 32, instead of 8 bits. Up to 4 bytes.
Able to represent 4 billion characters with 4 bytes.
Use unicode 'codepoint' to represent numbers more succinctly. More like U+1F44D.
Lots of emojis that are combinations of unicode codepoints, creating heart on fire etc.

## Colours - RGB
Combination of how much red/blue/green on a screen.
Each pixel contains a representation of 3 numbers, x red, x green, x blue.
Each one is a byte, so 0 - 255 for each colour.
3 bytes per pixel simplified.

## Music
Notes correlated to number.
Etc etc etc.


# Algorithms
This is the black box sitting between an input and output.
Take the input, run a specific algorithm, get a specific output.

## Time complexity
n, n/2, log2n. Phonebook example.
Correct algorithms are good, well designed ones are great.


# Assignment
Spent a lot of time on scratch 2+ years ago, no point me making a new program.

# Arrays

## Compiler
Transforms C code, or Java... into byte code, 0's and 1's. Source code to machine code.
To include a 3rd party library need to add -l___ to the CLA.
This explains why CS50 wouldn't work when I tried it on my PC.

Really...
Compiling is actually one of 4 steps.
1. Preprocessing - find and replace. Get's info from preprocesing directives.
2. Compiling
3.
4.

<!-- Prototypes -->
If not included, compiler would error out.

<!-- Preprocessor directive -->
#include <std...>

e.g. the #include <stdbool.h> directive contains prototypes and related code to booleans.
e.g. the #include <stdid.h> directive contains prototypes and related code to scanf, printf, etc.
